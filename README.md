WWU 2019 Design Senior Show

**Basic instructions for using GitHub:**

(one time)
* Download GitHub Desktop to your computer
* Clone this repository to your computer

(every time)
* When you want to start working, open GitHub desktop (make sure you are on the "develop" branch) and click "fetch origin"
* Open the code from the folder you downloaded in your favorite text editor
* Make whatever changes you want
* Commit your changes to "develop"
* Click "Push"

"Develop" branch is where we will make changes to the code, "master" branch is where the final reviewed code will live

**Pull Requests**
When all the code on the Develop branch has been reviewed and is ready to be finalized, we should make a pull request. There shouldn't be any conflicts, but after the PR is merged **don't** delete the develop branch.
